# HD-W60 reverse engineering


HD-W60 is a small, affordable LED controller board available from various online outlets. This repository aims to document, reverse engineer, and provide development tools the board, as it is a feature rich Wi-Fi enabled device.

# Hardware

HD-W60 v1.5 hardware contains the following MCUs and peripherals:

- TZ32F202C3T6 (For now I assume it is an STM32F202C3T6 clone)
- ESP8266EX (A well known WiFi enabled SoC)
- AiP8563 IÂ²C RTC with backup battery
- 74HC245 output drivers



The board has several IO ports listed below in no particular order:

- LED panel connections (2x HUB12 and 1x HUB8)
- USB host port
- Several GPIOs broken out on various headers
- ESP8266 USART (P20 header)

I believe that it can be turned into a powerful IoT development board if it is possible to run custom code on it.

# Peripheral structure

- U4 TZ32F202C3T6
  - U5 AiP8563
  - U18 P25Q16H
  - U6, U31 74HC245
- U1 ESP8266EX
  - U3 P25Q16H


# STM32 peripherals

The STM32 drives two output drivers for the LED panels with U31 and U6 74HC245. The USB port is connected to this MCU. STM32 is also connected to the U18 P25Q16H serial flash. 

## Headers 

### P12 (power)

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------
| 1   | Vdd |
